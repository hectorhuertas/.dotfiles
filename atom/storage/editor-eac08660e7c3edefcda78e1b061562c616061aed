Powered by the public data from Annie E. Casey foundation.\n\n###### Comments:\n* Testing / TDD seems solid overall\n* Good use of tests to make sure that each object can be used in isolation\n* Open-ended interfaces for objects makes it easy to pass customized data in for each test case\n* Top-level data processing and repo / record-creation flow is clean and easy to follow\n* Code complexity & length starts to fall down a lot in the analysis section. We discussed some ways to improve this by isolating argument and option parsing (determining which branch is need) from the methods that actually perform the calculations\n* Overall we might not reduce the amount of code, but we can probably organize in a way that's easier to follow\n* Finally, completion issues with the spec harness seem to stem from challenges dealing with data gaps or formats -- probably needed to identify this problem earlier. maybe by including more \"bad data\" in the tests from the beginning\n* Completion is good through I2 baseline (happy path); then has gaps around the missing data / edge case parsing\n\n###### Scores:\n\n* Functional Expectations 2\n* TDD 3\n* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 3\n* Fundamental Ruby & Style 2 -- needs some work refactoring analysis methods\n* Enumerable & Collections 4\n* Sanitation 3\n\n##### Feedback\n\nHector is smart, quick to understanding problems and works hard! Occasionally Hector needs to be told to explain his thought process. A weakness of Hector is he knows his process really well but is uncertain when presented with new ideas. Originally I thought it would be hard to work with Hector, but to my surprise it was a great experience and I would happily do it again.\n\n#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me\n\n* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ToniRib/http_yeah_you_know_me)\n* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)\n\nImplementation of and HTTP protocol based web server.\n\n###### Comments:\nTeam: Hector Huertas & Toni Rib\n\nAssessed By: Mike\n\n* 62 tests, all pass.\n* One extension\n* All functionality works.\n* Well organized, code, things were broken out into separate methods in a good fashion.\n* Think about class methods, and modules.\n\n###### Scores:\n* Overall Functionality: 4\n* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4\n* Test-Driven Development: 3\n* Breaking Logic into Components: 4\n\n##### Feedback\n\n Hector made a great partner for a project because we had very thoughtful discussions about how to solve problems. He made me take a step back from always trying to push forward to really understand everything that was happening in each method. He's great at test driven development. If he could improve at one thing it would be explaining his ideas a little more thoroughly, because sometimes it took me multiple explanations to understand what he was getting at.\n\n## Community\n\n### Giving Feedback\n\nToni Rib:\n* Working with Toni was a pleasure. I learned a lot with her about both programming and pairing. I really enjoyed our fluent communication and that we were free to discuss about any point of the approach or implementation. I love her result-oriented approach. She focuses on what matters and doesn’t waste time. As constructive criticism, she sometimes starts writing code before explaining what she is going to do, which joined with her fast thinking makes it quite hard to understand whats going on. Wrapping up, I’d love to have her as a partner again!\n\nAlex Navarrete:\n* Alex is very easy to work with. He listens carefully, thinks, and give his opinion. I like that he doesn't only want the code to work, but also understand why it works. He could use some more practice with the keyboard.\n\nTaylor Moore:\n* Taylor is a great partner. His communication skills are great and he's very easy to work with. Although he represents these skills, he might be too nonchalant while working on an assignment. Sometimes I felt he needed to feel more pressure to be more productive.\n In programming, he is great at force-breaking problems, he finds solutions for dark and hard to trace errors that doesn't seem to make sense. At the same time, he could improve his workflow for general problems: sometimes he starts wandering around code and trying things here and there when the answer is clear on the error stack trace. I think all around his approach is too time consuming. He could benefit from a more standard approach to problem solving and keep his dark magic for the times when it's really needed. In conclusion, great experience working with him.\n\n\n### Being a Community Member\n\nAlex Navarrete:\n* Besides being the only person I speak Spanish with, Hector is an excellent person when it comes to his work ethic. I remember that he was going through some housing issues as well and still managed to balance it all out.\n\n### Playing a Part\n\nI've gotten so much from the Turing Community that I feel in debt to them.\nThis is how I tried to pay them back:\n\n* I pick any abandoned glasses I see when on my way to return mine.\n* I put great care when using any resource\n* I do my best every time I give feedback.\n* I've always tried to be helpful and supportive, giving my best advice when\n asked and offering my help if seeing someone struggling.\n* I am an active member of my Posse, joining most of the warmups and hanging out\n with them both in and out of Turing.\n* I am an active member of the elixir club, encouraging my cohort peers to come\nto it by reviewing some of the coolest features of the language.\n* I have attended most DSA classes, and told my peer how useful they are\n\n## Review\n\n### Notes\n\n( Leave blanks for reviewers )\n\n### Outcome\n\n( Leave blanks for reviewers
