After the assessment it was improved with a GUI\n\n\n###### Comments:\nAssessed by: Horace\n\n* Good feature completion with 1 extension (handling large address file) added\n* Interesting ideas around module extraction for insertion logic\n* Good balance between node objects and top-level completion object; completion mostly handing off responsibilities to sub nodes\n* Code is overall quite clean -- short methods, good enumerable stuff making things concise\n* Would be interesting to refactor structure so that Substring and CompleteMe don't both have to have hash of links\n* Lots of tests, covering good cases\n* One small edge case around counting subsequent selections\n\n###### Scores:\n\n* Functional Expectations: 4\n* TDD: 3\n* Ruby Style & Fundamentals: 4\n* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic Into Components: 3\n* Enumerable & Collections: 4\n\n#### Binary Search Tree\n\n* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/binary_search_tree)\n* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)\n\nImplementation of a binary search tree\n\n###### Comments:\nAssessed by: Horace\n\n* Lot of tests\n* Like to see tests broken up by Node vs. Tree\n* Really interesting abstractions and approaches to minimizing if/else and nil-checking throughout the code\n* Mild use of metaprogramming within node lookup and assignment simplifies a lot of things\n* Like the use of childs array allowing us to leverage enumerables in the code\n* Be careful not to get carried away with the code optimizations such that we lose the inherent structure of the data structure\n\n###### Scores:\n\n* Functional Expectations: 4\n* Test-Driven Development: 4\n* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 4\n* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3\n* Enumerable & Collections: 4\n\n#### Night Writer\n\n* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/night_writer)\n* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)\n\nTool to read and translate Braille-like texts\n\n###### Comments:\n\nAssessed By: Horace\n\n* Don't micromanage your object -- give it a single method for overall task and have that cover the steps\n* Watch out for Map enumerable pattern -- creating empty objects and iteratively appending to them is a case for map\n* Look for opportunities to transform hardcoded data to inputs to some dynamic method\n* Don't be afraid to establish more meaningful vocabulary and terms specific to your problem\n* Pay attention to the level and importance you're assigning to various system components -- don't hide something as a local variable if it's an important piece\n\n###### Scores:\n\n* Overall Functionality: 1\n* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2\n* Test-Driven Development: 3\n* Breaking Logic into Components: 2.5\n\n#### Sorting Suite\n\n* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/sorting_suite)\n* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)\n\nImplementation of several fundamental sorting algorithms and a benchmarking tool to compare them.\n\n###### Comments:\n\nAssessed by: Beth Sebian\n\nBased on review of BubbleSort and InsertionSort. Did not have chance to review MergeSort.\n\n###### Scores:\n* Functional Expectations: 3 - Works as expected\n* Testing: 4 - Elaborate and thorough tests, well named\n* Ruby Style: 3 - Code runs effectively, some confusing methods\n* Organization: 2 - References multiple files that I think could be simplified\n\n## Team\n\n### Projects\n\nI completed the following team projects:\n\n#### Headcount\n\n* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/headcount)\n* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)\n\nAnalysis tool for the education system in Denver.
