# Notes about how to load plugins:
# * `light` is `load` without profiling, use always
# * `wait` is for parallel loading. hard to get right. not needed for now

# Load zinit
declare -A ZINIT # initialize ZINIT config array
ZINIT[HOME_DIR]=~/.local/share/zinit
source ~/.local/share/zinit/bin/zinit.zsh

# theme
zinit ice compile"(pure|async).zsh" pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh"
zinit light sindresorhus/pure

# plugins
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
zinit light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting # syntax must load second to last
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search # search must load last

# plugin options
HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHT_FOUND="standout" # standout in zshzle means inverted cell colors
HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHT_NOT_FOUND="fg=red,standout"
