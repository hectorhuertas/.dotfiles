# Hector Huertas' .dotfiles

Custom dotfiles system. The goal is to keep my dotfiles organized and version controlled while doing as much
as possible myself.

The dotfiles_old folder holds the old system that used Dotbot.

## To Do
* Create script to automate files copied
* Guide to making changes in dotfiles
* Small guide to follow after fresh install

## Topics to be added
* Brewfile
* gitconfig and gitignore_global
* macos
* iterm2

## Ignore
* .dotfiles
* All history files
* .CFUserTextEncoding (text encoding for user)
* .Trash/ (recycle bin)
* .dropbox (isn't user config)
* .gem (isn't user config)
* .rvm (isn't user config)
* .ssh (sensitive user data)
* .viminfo (isn't user config)

## Fresh install setup guide (WIP)

Install xcode and manually accept agreement
Install cli tools

brew + brewbundle

SSH keys (lastpass?)
macos

## How To
