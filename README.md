# Hector Huertas' .dotfiles

Custom dotfiles system. The goal is to keep my dotfiles organized and version controlled while doing as much
as possible myself.

The dotfiles_old folder holds the old system that used Dotbot.

## To Do
* Add sudo powers to brew script?
* Create script to automate files copied
* Guide to making changes in dotfiles
* Small guide to follow after fresh install

## Topics to be added
* Brewfile
* gitconfig and gitignore_global
* macos
* iterm2

## Ignore
* .dotfiles
* All history files
* .CFUserTextEncoding (text encoding for user)
* .Trash/ (recycle bin)
* .dropbox (isn't user config)
* .gem (isn't user config)
* .rvm (isn't user config)
* .ssh (sensitive user data)
* .viminfo (isn't user config)

## Fresh install setup guide (WIP)

* Install every system update
* Install 'Command Line Tools' with:
  * ```$ xcode-select --install```
* Install brew with:
  * ```$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
 ```



brew + brewbundle

SSH keys (lastpass?)
